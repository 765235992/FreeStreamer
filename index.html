<a name="welcome-to-freestreamer" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-freestreamer"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to FreeStreamer</h3>

<p>FreeStreamer is an audio player engine for iOS and OS X, designed for playing audio streams. The engine has a minimal UI for demonstration. Respectfully, see the <a href="https://github.com/muhku/FreeStreamer/tree/master/FreeStreamerDesktop">FreeStreamerDesktop</a> directory for OS X, and, <a href="https://github.com/muhku/FreeStreamer/tree/master/FreeStreamerMobile">FreeStreamerMobile</a> for the iOS UI.</p>

<p>The engine is written in C++ and the FSAudioController Objective-C class wraps the implementation.</p>

<p>FreeStreamer has the following features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fast and low memory footprint (no overhead of Objective-C method calls)</li>
<li>Supports ShoutCast and IceCast audio streams + standard HTTP</li>
<li>Can detect the stream type based on the content type</li>
<li>Supports ShoutCast metadata</li>
<li>Supports interruptions (for example a phone call during playing the stream)</li>
<li>Supports backgrounding</li>
<li>Supports a subset of the ID3v2 tag specification </li>
<li>Supports Podcast RSS feeds</li>
</ul>

<h3>API documentation</h3>

<p>
See <a href="http://freestreamer.io/api/">here</a>.
</p>

<h3>Using the player in your own project</h3>

<p>Please follow the following steps to use the player in your own project:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Make sure you have the following frameworks linked to your project:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>CFNetwork.framework</em></li>
<li><em>AudioToolbox.framework</em></li>
<li><em>AVFoundation.framework</em></li>
<li>
<em>libxml2.dylib</em> (add <code>$(SDKROOT)/usr/include/libxml2</code> to the header search path, if not found)</li>
<li>
<em>MediaPlayer.framework</em> (iOS only)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Add the <a href="https://github.com/muhku/FreeStreamer/tree/master/Common">Common</a> and <a href="https://github.com/muhku/FreeStreamer/tree/master/astreamer">astreamer</a> directories to your project. Try building the project now and it should compile successfully.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>iOS only</strong>: If you want to support background audio, add <em>App plays audio</em> to the target's <em>Required background modes</em>. You can find the property by clicking on the target on Xcode and opening the Info tab.</p></li>
</ol><p>You can now stream an audio file like this:</p>

<pre>
<code>#import "FSAudioStream.h"

FSAudioStream *audioStream = [[FSAudioStream alloc] init];
[audioStream playFromURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://www.example.com/audio_file.mp3"]];
</code></pre>

<p>
Some servers may send an incorrect MIME type. In this case, FreeStreamer may not be able to play the stream. If you want to avoid the content-type checks (that the stream actually is an audio file), you can set the following property:
</p>

<pre>
<code>audioStream.strictContentTypeChecking = NO;
// Optionally, set the content-type where to fallback to
audioStream.defaultContentType = "audio/mpeg";
</code></pre>

<p>
For streaming playlists, you need to use the <a href="https://github.com/muhku/FreeStreamer/blob/master/Common/FSAudioController.h">FSAudioController.h</a> class. The class has some additional logic to resolve the playback URLs:
</p>

<pre>
<code>#import "FSAudioController.h"

FSAudioController *audioController = [[FSAudioController alloc] init];
audioController.url = @"http://www.example.com/my_playlist.pls";
[audioController play];
</code>
</pre>

It is also possible to check the exact content of the stream by using the <a href="https://github.com/muhku/FreeStreamer/blob/master/Common/FSCheckContentTypeRequest.h">FSCheckContentTypeRequest.h</a> and <a href="https://github.com/muhku/FreeStreamer/blob/master/Common/FSParsePlaylistRequest.h">FSParsePlaylistRequest.h</a> classes:

<pre><code>FSCheckContentTypeRequest *request = [[FSCheckContentTypeRequest alloc] init];
request.url = @"http://www.example.com/not-sure-about-the-type-of-this-file";
request.onCompletion = ^() {
	if (self.request.playlist) {
		// The URL is a playlist; now do something with it...
	}
};
request.onFailure = ^() {   
};

[request start];
</code></pre>

<p>
That's it! For more examples, please take a look at the example project. For instance, you may want to observe notifications on the audio stream state.
</p>
